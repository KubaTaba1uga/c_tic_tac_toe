I need to rewrite game alittle bit:
1. Split user and game state. Replacement in GameState should be named 'play'.
2. Propose three queues inside game state machine: 
  2.1 Prepare, which sets data for processing, ex. CreateUserMove, InvalidMoveCleanup etc.
  2.2 Process, which generates results like next user or next state.
  2.3 Post, which performs operations on game state machine data based on results, 
      like write next user to game state machine user or write next state to game
      state machine state.
3. Make user move sm part of sm subsystem.
4. Ops datastructures should be available via a get function. This should clean up some boilercode.
